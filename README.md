# Voronoi-based Lattice Distances
The repository contains the code of Voronoi-based Lattice Distances which encodes crystal lattices to Voronoi Domains and runs Voronoi-based metrics to compare them. 
The code is written in C++ and CMake. More details on the used metrics can be found in our paper published in the Crystal Research & Technology Journal: [Voronoi-Based Similarity Distances between Arbitrary Crystal Lattices](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/crat.201900197).

The project has been compiled and run only on `Windows x64`.

## Installation
### Download and install dependencies
1. Install Visual Studio (e.g. Community) choosing the following `single components`:
    - `.NET SDK`
    - `.NET 7.0 Runtime`
    - `MSVC v142 - C++ Build tools`
    - `MSVC v143 - C++ Build tools`
    - `C++/CLI for Build Tools v142`
    - `Windows 10 SDK (10.2.20348.0)`
    - `CMake C++ Tools for Windows`
    - `Git for Windows`

2. The software and shared libraries below must be installed by the user through Windows installers:
    - [CGAL-4.14.3-Setup.exe](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/tag/releases%2FCGAL-4.14.3) 
    
      Note: Install it in `VoronoiLatticeDistances\External\CGAL-4.14.3` folder and choose `64bit` binaries.

    - [boost_1_69_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.69.0/)

      Note: Install in `VoronoiLatticeDistances\External\boost_1_69_0` folder.

3. Add the following environmental variables as User:
    - `VS_DIR`: Path to Visual Studio with all folders (e.g. `Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community`)
    
4. Download the repository

5. Run the following in a `Command Prompt` (no PowerShell) to build and install it:
    ```
      "%VS_DIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64
      cd VoronoiLatticeDistances/windows-setup
      dotnet build
      dotnet run
    ```

## Usage: Run the metric computations
To compute correctly the metrics, it is required that all input CIF files contain the primitive unit cell.
Running the executable `voronoilatticedistances.exe` without parameters, it outputs the usage as follows: 

Required options: 

- `-inputdir`		[Input Folder with CIF files] 
- `-outputdir`	[Output Folder to write metric results] 

Output options (at least 1 required): 

- `-vol`   Outputs .csv file with Voronoi Cell volume 
- `-vtp`   Outputs .vtp files with Voronoi Cell of a Lattice (Paraview format file) 
- `-csv`   Outputs .csv files with Lattice and Voronoi Cell points 
- `-off`   Outputs .off files with Voronoi Cell vertices and faces 
- `-ds`    Outputs .csv file with Scale Invariant Distance matrix (n x n) between all n crystal lattices 
- `-dh`    Outputs .csv file with Extended Hausdorff Distance matrix (n x n) between all n crystal lattices 

Optional commands: 

- `-intervals`	[integer n (default n=2)]	It affects the number of rotation samples to be considered for metric computations (total number of rotations: 4*pi^2*n^3) 
- `-threads`		[integer t (default t=1)]	Rotation samples are divided among t threads

If users want to divide the voronoi cell computation from the metric computation, they can run `voronoilatticedistances_off.exe` to compute only the metrics from OFF files.

Required options:

- `-inputdir`		[Input Folder with Voronoi Cell OFF files]
- `-outputdir`	[Output Folder to write metric results]

Output options (at least 1 required):

- `-ds`	Outputs .csv file with Scale Invariant Distance matrix (n x n) between all n crystal structures
- `-dh`	Outputs .csv file with Extended Hausdorff Distance matrix (n x n) between all n crystal structures

Optional commands:

- `-intervals`	[integer n (default n=2)]	It affects the number of rotation samples to be considered for metric computations (number of rotations: 4*pi^2*n^3)
- `-threads`		[integer t (default t=1)]	Rotation samples are divided among t threads

## Example of Voronoi Domains
There are following the Voronoi domains of 5 real crystal lattices from the `T2 dataset` used in our experiments: T2-epsilon, T2-delta, T2-beta, T2-gamma and T2-alpha. Plus, the voronoi domains of the standard cubic, body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic lattices.

## Dendrogram and Heatmap
The dendrogram and the heatmap of the Voronoi-based metrics can be generated with the following script. The input csv file is generated by the options `-dh` or `-ds` of the previous executables.

```
RScript.exe .\Scripts\make_dendrogram_heatmap.R [csv file]
```
